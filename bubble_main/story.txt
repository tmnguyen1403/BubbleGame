						Bubble Game
In 3xxx year, the Earth was attacked by bubble aliens coming from the Bubble Galaxy. They’ve been studied human since the dawn of mankind and decided to enslave human. With the overwhelming technology and alien powers, they swiftly destroyed all governments on Earth. Their army are divided into three battalions. The red battalion feeds on human blood. The green battalion feeds on plant. The blue battalion feeds on the ocean. Together, they dominated the Earth. It was the doom of mankind. However, many were able to fleet to different planets after the attack. The second Earth, located near the belt of Galaxy XYZ, became our safe haven. The Resistance was formed to protect the remnant of mankind and to develop weapons to destroy the bubble aliens. After 30 years, the Resistance was able to develop a bio weapon based on the enemy’s DNA. They called it multi-color bubble gun which can shoot bubble with 3 different colors (red, green, blue) based on the color DNA of the enemy.
